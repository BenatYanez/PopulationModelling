```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Goals for this practical

* #### Build a discrete population model with logistic growth and visualize it
* #### Build a continuos population model and visualize it
* #### Calibrate the model, estimating parameters r and K and P(0) based on simulated data
